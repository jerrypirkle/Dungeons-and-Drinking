            <h3>Session 1</h3>
                <p>Our party has arrived in Port Nyanzaru<br>
                We are at the Thundering Lizard for some rest and some stew<br><br>

                We have been tasked by Sndra to find an artifact (soul monger)<br>
                But Chult is untamed and we first need a guide to put us on track<br><br>

                This town is rough, with unfamiliar tongue and rules<br>
                And is under constant assault, by roaming ghouls<br><br>

                Our adventure so far has already been hard<br>
                But at least we fared better than those poor town guards</p><br>

            <h3>Session 2</h3>
                <p>Ko won coin on the dino race<br>
                And Light made a deal to save some face<br><br>

                A bookie blackmailed him into a dirty deed<br>
                After he failed to steal the bokkie's gold<br><br>

                But in the end it was the bookie who was rolled <br>
                And the victim, now richer, was freed<br><br>

                We finally found our jungle guide<br>
                And set forth for gold, for glory, for pride<br><br>

                At the Righteous camp we did arrive<br>
                But we almost did not leave alive<br><br>

                We barely conqured the cursed gator temple<br>
                Because our party, well, we're sometimes somewhat simple<br><br>

                We then fought some goblin grunts who wanted our new jug<br>
                But we made short work of the runts and we made ready to chug</p><br>


            <h3>Session 3</h3>
                <p>We made our way to camp vengeance<br>
                Where their leader requested our attendance<br><br>

                He offered us lodging in his Fort<br>
                But in exchange, we were...compelled to escort his sick to port<br><br>

                In the end, the camp was little more than a pig pen<br>
                Full of bean-eating paladins: men who enjoyed the company of other men</p><br>

            <h3>Session 4</h3>
                <p>We met a group of tree lovers who tried turn us from our path<br>
                But rather than join their crusade, we kept our word headed back to town for a drink and a bath<br><br>

                We met with a kind merchant price<br>
                And our patron, so near death she was almost ash<br><br>

                But Queldar endured the stench and incense<br>
                And stuck our patron for more cash</p><br>

            <h3>Session 5</h3>
                <p>Just before we left port Nyanzaru<br>
                I ran into someone I once knew<br><br>

                A druid and botanist who used to sell me herb<br>
                And If I recall, his product was quite superd<br><br>

                A Goliath stronger, we once again entered the jungle<br>
                To find yet another adventure to bungle<br><br>

                Then we found a tower, a flaming finger<br>
                And while inside snack befriended a winged stranger<br><br>

                We then visited the bird's home in a cliff face<br>
                Where a whispering princess pleaded her case<br><br>

                And we were told of a magical rite<br>
                That would give us the gift of flight</p><br>
