            <p>Session 1</p>
                <p>Our party has arrived in Port Nyanzaru<br>
                We are at the Thundering Lizard for some rest and some stew<br>

                We have been tasked by Sndra to find an artifact (soul monger)<br>
                But Chult is untamed and we first need a guide to put us on track<br>

                This town is rough, with unfamiliar tongue and rules<br>
                And is under constant assault, by roaming ghouls<br>

                Our adventure so far has already been hard<br>
                But at least we fared better than those poor town guards</p>

            <p>Session 2</p>
                <p>Ko won coin on the dino race<br>
                And Light made a deal to save some face<br>

                A bookie blackmailed him into a dirty deed<br>
                After he failed to steal the bokkie's gold<br>

                But in the end it was the bookie who was rolled <br>
                And the victim, now richer, was freed<br>

                We finally found our jungle guide<br>
                And set forth for gold, for glory, for pride<br>

                At the Righteous camp we did arrive<br>
                But we almost did not leave alive<br>

                We barely conqured the cursed gator temple<br>
                Because our party, well, we're sometimes somewhat simple<br>

                We then fought some goblin grunts who wanted our new jug<br>
                But we made short work of the runts and we made ready to chug</p>
