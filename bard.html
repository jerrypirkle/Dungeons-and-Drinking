           <p id="t">The bard's lute is out of tune and his poems are lewd. He introduces himself as Liam Longtongue, "Not a family name, mister. If you must know, ask your sister. And if she's too shy to answer true, well then you may ask your mother too." His fashionable clothes are colorful and well worn from travel. He offers to recite a poem for a small fee, or to insult you for free.</p><p></p>

                    And we'll see if your sword will sting; 
                    As much as these words that I sling; 

                    <li>- Well, I agree that your sword hurt more; 
                    But at least...my mother wasn't a whore</li>

                    <li>- I've said far worse things to much better men</li>

                <li>- The young witch I took home was a prize<br>
                    Pretty, big breasts, and big eyes<br>
                    But I began to suspect<br>
                    That I was incorrect <br>
                    When I found a wand between her two thighs</li><p></p>

                    About a bard, whose spear was quite long <br>
                    In fact it was so big <br>
                    That it makes yours seem a twig<br>
                    And your wife would not say I was wrong<br> </li><p></p>
                <li>- Have you heard of the Rogue named Red?<br>
                    He took a king's daughter to bed<br>
                    But when daddy did knock<br>
                    The whole town was in shock<br>
                    For he neglected his pants as he fled</li><p></p>

                <li>- I am a bard for hire<br>
                    Whom all the fair maidens desire<br>
                    I'm quick with my wits<br>
                    And when not falling face first into pits<br>
                    I happen to spit fire</li><p></p>

                <li>- Ko is devoted to his god<br>
                    Queldar at least gives his a nod<br>
                    But I have my music<br>
                    and so I shall use it<br>
                    To heal my mistreated squad</li><p></p>

                <li>- Now that our life's on the line<br>
                    There will never be a better time<br>
                    To grant you some health<br>

                    To think of the next rhyme</li><p></p>

                <li>- There once was a Nobleman who laid <br>
                    Loudly with a young blonde scullery maid,<br>
                    The Nobleman's Wife <br>
                    Then took the butcher's knife,<br>
                    And carved some peace and quiet with her blade </li><p></p>

                <li>- There was once a Red Wizard of Thay<br>
                    Who would polish his wand every day<br>
                    He'd oil up the shaft<br>
                    Work his wizardly craft<br>
                    And produce a most magical spray!</li><p></p>

                To the fortune lost, to forsaken halls<br><br>

                A princess fair will unite the clans<br>
                And she will reclaim her forgotten lands<br><br>

                Come one, come all to aid our cause<br>
                Please come with haste and do not pause<br><br>

                A curse of death affects us all<br>
                you'll be next if you ignore our calls</p>
